## Measure theory/Basics

Two solutions to Banach Tarski (paradox under ZFC):

- Reject axiom of choice
- Accept the concept of non-measurable sets -> Measure Theory

For set \(\Omega\) an \(\sigma-algebra\) on \(\Omega\) is a collection \(\mathscr{A} \subset 2^{\Omega}\) s.t. \(\mathscr{A}\) is non-empty and:

- closed under complements \((E\in\mathscr{A} => E^c\in\mathscr{A})\)

- closed under countable unions (\(E_1,E_2, ... \in \mathscr{A} => \cup^{\inf}_{i=1}E_i \in \mathscr{A}\))

\(2^{\Omega}\) is the power set i.e. all possible subsets of \(\Omega\).

- \(\Omega \in \mathscr{A}\)
- \(\emptyset \in \mathscr{A}\)
